    <h3>Bowling &bullet; Dinner &bullet; Karaoke &bullet; Board Games &bullet; Cake &bullet; Prizes</h3>
    <p>To celebrate 10 years of the PHP UK Conference we've planned a fantastic party for all of our delegates.</p>
    <h3>Sponsored by</h3>
    <p><a href="#new-relic">New Relic</a> and <a href="#dreamfactory">Dream Factory</a></p>
    <h3>Location</h3>
    <p>We'll be heading to <a href="http://www.allstarlanes.co.uk/venues/brick-lane/">All Star Lanes</a> bowling alley on historic Brick Lane in East London where we have exclusive hire of the entire venue.</p>
    <h3>Getting There</h3>
    <p>There will be busses running all delegates from the Brewery to All Star Lanes directly after the closing sessions, between 6-7pm. As you can imagine, it will take some time to get 700 people on a bus, so just head to the King George and grab a free drink while checking out the exhibitors until your bus is ready &mdash; thank you for your patience with this.</p>
    <p>If you need to come to the venue later and will be making your own way, please remember to bring your badge in order to gain entry to the event.</p>
    <p>The closest station to All Star Lanes is Shoreditch High Street.</p>
    <h3>Getting In</h3>
    <p>Your conference badge will be required for entrance. If you are attending on Friday only and do not have a badge yet, please give your name at the door and the doorman can check you in.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately children under 18 years of age are not able to attend the event, due to licensing rules at the venue.</p>
    <h3>Activities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>9 bowling lanes</li>
        <li>2 private karaoke rooms</li>
        <li>3 pool tables</li>

        <li>Board games</li>
        <li>Dinner &amp; dessert</li>
        <li>Bars, tables, and couches to relax and hang out</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Food &amp; Drink</h3>
    <p>Since we are going straight from the conference to the social, we'll have a delicious dinner buffet.</p>
    <p>And you can't have a birthday party without birthday cake!</p>
    <p>There will be vegetarian options available. If you have other dietary requirements, please <a href="mailto:contact@phpconference.co.uk">contact us</a> with your order number and requirements.</p>
