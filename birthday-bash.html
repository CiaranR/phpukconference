            <p>To celebrate 10 years of the PHP UK Conference we've planned a fantastic party for all of our delegates.</p>
            <p>As the first day of the conference draws to a close on Thursday we will be moving on to All Star Lanes on Brick Lane. Join us for plenty of free food, unlimited free bowling, a huge birthday cake, <a href="/beer-factory/">lots of beers</a> and more.</p>
            <h3>Location</h3>
            <p><a href="http://www.allstarlanes.co.uk/venues/brick-lane/">All Star Lanes</a> is a bowling alley on the historic Brick Lane in East London, where we have exclusive hire of the entire venue.</p>
            <h3>Getting There</h3>
            <p>There will be busses running all delegates from the Brewery to All Star Lanes directly after the closing sessions, between 6-7pm. As you can imagine, it will take some time to get 700 people on a bus, so just head to the King George room and grab a free drink while checking out the exhibits until your bus is ready &mdash; thank you for your patience with this.</p>
            <p>If you need to come to the venue later and will be making your own way, please remember to bring your badge in order to gain entry to the event.</p>
            <p>The closest station to All Star Lanes is Shoreditch High Street.</p>
            <h3>Getting In</h3>
            <p>Your conference badge will be required for entrance. If you are attending on Friday only and do not have a badge yet, please give your name at the door and the doorman can check you in.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately people under 18 years of age are not able to attend the event, due to licensing rules at the venue.</p>
            <h3>Activities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>9 bowling lanes</li>
