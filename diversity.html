    <h1>Diversity</h1>
    <p>PHP UK Conference is dedicated to improving diversity in the technology industry. Over the past few years, we've taken steps towards making PHP UK a welcoming and inclusive event for all attendees. Some of the changes we've implemented are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>2014 - Created a <a href="/conduct">Code of Conduct</a> for all PHP London events</li>
        <li>2015 - Revised Call for Papers process to include anonymised voting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>PHP UK Conference Scholarship Programme</h2>
    <p>For 2016 we want to take a big step forward and that's why we're launching the PHP UK Conference Scholarship Programme. This program will offer awardees a complimentary ticket and a travel &amp; accommodation stipend to come to PHP UK Conference. Scholarships are available to women, ethnic minorities, LGBTQ people, and other underrepresented groups who would not traditionally have the opportunity or access to attend PHP UK.</p>
    <p>In order to work, this scholarship programme requires huge investment from both the PHP UK Conference staff and from the whole community as well. </p>
    <p>We are currently accepting donations to fund scholarships in 2016. 100% of all donations go directly to scholarship awardees.</p>

    <p>More information will be posted in the coming months, including information for applicants and information about sponsorship opportunities.</p>
