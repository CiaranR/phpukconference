    <h1>Diversity</h1>
    <p>PHP UK Conference is dedicated to improving diversity in the technology industry. Over the past few years, we've taken steps towards making PHP UK a welcoming and inclusive event for all attendees. Some of the changes we've implemented are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>2014 - Created a <a href="/conduct">Code of Conduct</a> for all PHP London events</li>
        <li>2015 - Revised Call for Papers process to include anonymised voting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>PHP UK Conference Scholarship Programme</h2>


	<p>PHP UK's scholarship program provides aide to members of underrepresented groups who may not 	otherwise be able to attend our conference for financial reasons.</p>

	<h2>Eligibility</h2>
	<p>Applicants should be a member of an underrepresented group in tech - women, minorities, 	LGBTQIA, people with disabilities, or other underrepresented groups not listed - and be unable 	to attend without some financial assistance. We have a strong preference for U.K. applicants to 	stretch our scholarship funds as far as possible.</p>

	<h2>Guidelines</h2>
	<p>Scholarships are awarded based on a combination of need and impact. Selection will be made 	by an assembled group of reviewers who will assess each applicant's request. Our target for PHP 	UK 2016 is to provide access to 50 or more Scholarship awardees.</p>

	<p>If you are employed, and your employer is able to sponsor your travel, we will list them as 	a scholarship sponsor.</p>

	<p>Scholarship recipients will be awarded an event ticket with the full benefits of a paid 	event registration, including lunch, snacks, and evening events. Each scholarship recipient will 	also be appointed a mentor that can help familiarize the awardee with the conference.</p>
