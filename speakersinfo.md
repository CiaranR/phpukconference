## The Long Version

### Slides Format
All rooms will have projectors and screens configured in 16:9 format. Your slides should be compatible with this, however if that is not possible, you can still use 4:3 slides which will appear with a black border around them. 

### Video Input
All rooms will have HDMI and VGA connectors for your laptop on the lectern. If you'd like to run your presentation off the AV crew's equipment, this is possible, however the laptop will be Windows based, supporting only PowerPoint. 

### Audio Input
If your presentation requires audio, this will be fed via HDMI. 

### Microphones
All rooms have headset mics for the speaker to wear. There is also a stationary mic attached to the lectern for improved sound quality. 

### Video Relay
Only the main track has a comfort monitor in it, as the stage is so large. It will display what is currently being projected on screen. The two side track rooms are oriented as such that you will use your laptop as a comfort monitor as the stages are much smaller there. 

If you're speaking in side track 1 (downstairs) this room is split across 2 rooms for increased capacity, so the second room will have a video + audio feed of your presentation for delegates to watch. Q&A does come from this room as well, there is a doorway just to the left of the stage which leads to the second room. 

### Capacity
- Main Track: 700
- Side Track 1: 200
- Side Track 2: 200

### Talk length
Talk slots are 60 minutes long, including time for Q&A. Time for Q&A is up to you, but 5-10 minutes is the recommended length. 
Keynote slots are 30 minutes long, and do not have Q&A. 

### Internet
The conference wifi is available in all rooms and is extremely reliable (really!). 

### Tech Check
Please come at least 10-15 minutes early for your talk. The AV crew are awesome and would really love to run a full tech check with every speaker before their talk slot. This includes getting your slides on screen and making any adjustments to the projector, getting yourself on stage and adjusting lighting, getting you mic'd up and doing a sound check, and checking clickers/other peripherals. This takes more than 2 minutes to do while delegates are sitting down, so please arrive to your room as soon as possible. 

If you are doing a keynote, you are required to come for a full tech check at least 30 minutes prior to your talk. For morning keynotes, please arrive at 0830. For afternoon keynotes, there is less time, so please come over lunch for a run through and to familiarise yourself with the stage. Then final checks will run at 1700-1710.

### Staff
All rooms will have a room manager from our volunteer team and 1-2 sound technicians to assist you with your talk. The sound desk will be located at the back of the room. The room manager will be able to help you with any questions you have. I will be floating between rooms to check in on things, but please check with your room manager first with any problems. 

### Video recording
All talks will be video recorded and posted for free on our YouTube channel. Please give a copy of your slides before/after your talk to the technician at the sound desk - these get incorporated into the videos. 

### Speaker's dinner
The speaker's dinner will be on {date} at {restaurant}, which {location information}. We will be in {room inside restaurant}. Please join us at 1830 for drinks, and first courses will be served at 1900. We will aim to leave for the delegate's social around 2100.
