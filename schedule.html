              There exist quite a few misconceptions when it comes to the Dependency Injection (DI) pattern. While the principal pattern is easy to understand, it can be difficult to succeed with DI. In this session I will share some of my real world experience with DI. I will guide you to use DI in "The Right Way™" to get the most out of it and to increase the maintainability of your application.

            abstract: |
              Here's one to give the PHP bashers a well-deserved black eye! Twitter is one of the world's best know social media sites, handling over 500 million public tweets a day (that's around 6,000 tweets a second).  Together, they're delivered to select partners as a 'firehose' of data, who in turn deliver it on to their customers. DataSift is one of Twitter's firehose partners, and when someone presses 'Send' in their Twitter client, we aim to get that tweet into the hands of our customers in about 1 second. And PHP plays several key roles in making that possible.  Come along and hear Stuart explain just how.

            abstract: |
              Software Architecture is hard. And when your business grows, its getting even harder because scaling doesn’t come out the box and it’s not only the software which grows it’s also the team. So you have to find a way how to scale your software in a way that it stays easy maintainable for growing teams and scalable. I’d like to talk about Service Orientated Architecture in general and also share some experience and give some examples where SOA would save you in a tough spot and maybe places where SOA isn’t the best idea to implement.

            abstract: |
              Application metrics are extremely important but are often hard to gather as our PHP Applications differ significantly.  Using StatsD and Graphite we can gather metrics from our applications no matter what their shape or form. In this talk I will discuss how you can use Statsd to send various metrics of your PHP applications to Graphite. StatsD is a simple NodeJS daemon for easy stats aggregation and makes it simple to plot application metrics on a graph in Graphite. Using the metrics that are gathered its possible to get an overview of what is happening with our applications in near realtime which is extremely useful. Graphite additionally allows us to produce easy understandable graphs and dashboards which once analysed can be used to improve our PHP applications. My talk will cover everything from setting up Statsd and Graphite to how you gather the metrics from within your PHP applications. After the talk developers should be confident enough to go away and implement these technologies in their applications.

              Lots of people think that using Symfony2 is an overkill for small websites and also that it is too slow for big projects. I will try to demonstrate that it is just not true. The talk will cover all those tips and tricks which are necessary to maximize performance and achieve scalability in big traffic applications using Symfony2. From system configurations (both in PHP/Opcode caches and Symfony2), autoload optimization, some easy quick wins, how to profile properly with xDebug/XHProf, SQL vs NoSQL to even some war stories (and solutions) from Hailo, Privalia, Ulabox, Emagister and SocialPoint which are high traffic environments I've worked for.

              The Standard PHP Library (SPL) might be one of the most powerful, yet the most unused part of PHP, but you are one of those lucky developers who have discovered it! But now what? The lack of documentation about SPL makes it that a lot users don't really harvest the power that SPL brings. During this presentation I will dive into the numerous iterators, data-structures and interfaces that SPL defines and when & how to implement them in your own projects, but we will talk about the edge-cases as well, as in SPL land things don't always are what they seem..

              We’ve all experienced performance issues and we would typically turn to a profiler. Whether that’s something in userland, or a tool like xdebug or xhprof, the reason is the same: to figure out why our code is slow. This talk will take that inspection a step further and look under the hood of PHP, at the C internals, for common performance problems. If you’ve ever wanted to know exactly what your code is doing, and why ++$i is faster than $i++, this talk is for you. Note: This is an advanced talk, you should be extremely familiar with PHP and have some experience with profiling if you are to get the most from this talk.

              In this world where we have moved beyond web pages and build ever-more asynchronous applications, often things that go wrong result in errors we can't see.  This session will give a very technical overview of HTTP and how to inspect your application's communications, whether on the web or on a mobile device.  Using Curl, Wireshark and Charles, we can quickly and painlessly identify where the problem exists, without spending a lot of time making changes to our application to identify a problem.  Whether you're debugging a backend API, an ajax request or an unexpected timeout, these are the tools you will want to have at hand.

This is for example useful for calculating the moon phase, or sunrise/sunset. We will also look at coordinate systems on solar system bodies and do calculations with that. I have a couple of other things up my sleeve too. Expect trigonometry and other maths, and rocket science/explosions.

              It's nothing new that speed is important for the success of any web application. Only a few hundred milliseconds may lie between a user leaving your site or staying. Unfortunately performance problems are oftentimes hard to fix and even harder to pinpoint. In this talk I will show you how we at ResearchGate measure web application performance, which means not only timing how long the PHP backend took to deliver a page, but also tracking the speed the users actually perceives in the browser. After that you will see how you can track down and analyze any problems you found through measuring with the help of tools like Xdebug, XHProf and the Symfony Debug Toolbar. And if you still need to get faster after optimizing and fixing all these issues, I'll introduce you to some tricks, techniques and patterns to even further decrease load times.

            title: Unbreakable Domain Models
            speaker: Mathias Verraes
            slug: mathiasverraes
            abstract: |
              Data Mappers (like Doctrine2) help us a lot to persist data. Yet many projects are still struggling with tough questions:
              <ul><li>Where to put business logic?</li>
              <li>How to protect our code from abuse?</li>
              <li>Where to put queries, and how test them?</li></ul>

              <p>Let’s look beyond the old Gang of Four design patterns, and take some clues from tactical Domain Driven Design. At the heart of our models, we can use Value Objects and Entities, with tightly defined consistency boundaries. Repositories abstract away the persistence.  Encapsulated Operations helps us to protect invariants. And if we need to manage a lot of complexity, the Specification pattern helps us express business rules in the language of the business. These patterns help us evolve from structural data models, to rich behavioral models. They capture not just state and relationships, but true meaning. The presentation is a fast paced introduction to some patterns and ideas that will make your Domain Model expressive, unbreakable, and beautiful.</p>

            title: "Building scalable PHP applications using Google’s App Engine"
            speaker: Ian Barber and Mandy Waite

              At Google I/O 2013 back in June, we announced the addition of a new PHP language runtime for App Engine. Google App Engine allows you to build web applications on the same scalable systems that power Google applications.

              In this talk we’ll take a look at building and running highly scalable PHP applications on the App Engine platform. Here’s some of the topics that we’ll cover:
                <ul><li>Deploying and running popular PHP applications and frameworks on App Engine</li>
                <li>Differences between applications running on App Engine and a typical LAMP stack</li>
                <li>Using asynchronous calls for I/O requests</li>
                <li>Utilising App Engine services such as task queues, memcache, mail and servers.</li>
                <li>Composing applications with Google Cloud Storage and Google Cloud SQL</li></ul>

              Put on your trench coat and grab your magnifying glass as we walk through investigating a real-life hacked WordPress website. You'll experience first-hand what tools can help you find the vulnerability and the point of entrance. Learn what the hacker might have left behind, how to seal up the most common problem areas, and how to set up notifications to help you spot a hack more quickly in the future. Even though we will be going through a WordPress website, most of the tools discussed are applicable to any website.
