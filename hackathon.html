    <h1>Hackathon</h1>
    <h2>Presented by Jetbrains</h2>
    <p>For the third time we will be hosting a Hackathon alongside the main tracks and, as it's our 10th birthday, this year it will be party themed!</p>
    <p>We are looking for teams to produce web apps inspired by traditional birthday party games. Think pass the parcel, pin the tail on the donkey, musical chairs, etc.</p>
    <p>There will be prizes awarded throughout the Hackathon for the most innovative hacks and the winners will get <b>two free tickets to next year’s conference, PHP Storm licenses and more</b>. There will also be the opportunity to present your hack on the main stage after the final talk to all the delegates.</p>
