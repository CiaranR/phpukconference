  <h1>CALL FOR PAPERS</h1>
  <h2>Closes October 19<sup>th</sup> 2015 9AM GMT</h2>
  
  <p>The 2016 Call for Papers is now closed. Thanks to all who submitted! We will be in touch over the next few weeks with the results of your submission.</p>
  <p>The schedule will be announced on November 9th 2015. </p>
  
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The main attraction of any conference is the talks that are given and we aim to attract the best PHP speakers from around the world. We solicit talks through a call for papers so you, the community, can tell us what kinds of things everyone should be hearing about.</p>
  <p>We are looking for talks relating to any non-basic aspect of the PHP programming language, be it mainstream, advanced, niche or non-technical. We are looking for real 'wow' talks that are fresh and inspiring about cutting edge topics or new perspectives on common problems. The audience will be from all backgrounds varying in skill level from beginner to intermediate to advanced, so talks varying widely in topic and skill levels are required. Most of all we want speakers who have a deep knowledge about the topics they are proposing and can't wait to share that knowledge with a whole group of of eager listeners. Tell us what you're most passionate about and why we should be passionate about it as well.</p>
  <h2>Selection Process</h2>
  <p>We receive on average 300 papers for 34 talk slots. In order to select these 34 talks, we use the following 3 step process: </p>
  <ol>
      <li>Using an anonymized list of all papers (contains talk title, abstract, and 'why you should choose this talk'), the organisers rate each talk from 1-5 to create a shortlist of around 60 abstracts.</li>
      <li>Abstracts are then discussed and put in order of must have talks, with the top 40-50 papers being the focus.</li>
      <li>Submissions are then deanonymized and final selections are made based on the speaker's location/cost of travel and level of the talk.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Package</h2>
  <p>What's in it for me? Fame and fortune! Well, maybe not just yet, but, speaking at a conference is a great way to give back to the amazing PHP community that has given so much to you. In addition to giving back to the community, we are very pleased to be able to offer the following benefits package to all our speakers:</p> 
  <ul>
      <li>Entry to the conference (both days) and all the social events</li>
      <li>Travel expenses paid in full</li>

      <li>Invitation to the complimentary speaker's dinner (Wednesday night)</li>
  </ul>
