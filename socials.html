            <p>Friday night we'll be hosting our mid-conference social. We'll start at the conference venue with a huge prize raffle, open for all delegates. We'll have FREE drinks for a couple hours giving you a chance to meet and network with all the other delegates and check out the exhibits too. If you're participating in the Hackathon or want to pop by and check it out, it'll be running until 11pm. We'll then move on to another venue. More details coming soon!</p>
