    <h1>Socials</h1>
    <p>An important part of any conference is being able to network with other delegates and PHP UK is no exception. We've arranged three social events - before, during and after the conference. Venues and exact times will be announced in early 2015.</p>
    <div class="col-third">
        <h2>Wednesday</h2>
        <p>Wednesday night kicks off the conference with a night at a pub just around the corner from the conference venue. Previously known as the Master Gunner, the newly rebranded Finch's is located opposite Finsbury square, close to Moorgate tube and Old Street Station.</p>
        <p>Drinks are sponsored by <a href="http://www.phplondon.org">PHP London</a>. You can find more details about Finch's and their address <a href="http://www.finchspub.co.uk">on their website.</a></p>

        <h2>Thursday</h2>
        <p>On Thursday night we'll be hosting our birthday party at a really cool local venue. We'll have the place to ourselves all night so you can come and play some games, grab plenty of free food and make use of one of the multiple bars.</p>
        <p>Full details will be available in the next few days.</p>
